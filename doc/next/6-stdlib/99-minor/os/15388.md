On Windows, [NewFile] supports overlapped (a.k.a non-blocking) file handles even
when the handle can't be added to the Go runtime I/O Completion Port (IOCP), normally
because it is already attached to another IOCP. The I/O operations will be performed in
a blocking manner instead of using the Go runtime IOCP.
Particularly, this means that is now possible to reliably pass overlapped named pipes and
sockets to a Go process standard input, output, and error.
