When `GODEBUG=checkfinalizers=1` is set, the runtime will run
diagnostics on each garbage collection cycle to find common issues
with how the program might use finalizers and cleanups, such as those
described [in the GC
guide](/doc/gc-guide#Finalizers_cleanups_and_weak_pointers). In this
mode, the runtime will also regularly report the finalizer and
cleanup queue lengths to stderr to help identify issues with
long-running finalizers and/or cleanups.
