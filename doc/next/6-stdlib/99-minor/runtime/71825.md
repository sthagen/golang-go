Cleanup functions scheduled by [AddCleanup] are now executed
concurrently and in parallel, making cleanups more viable for heavy
use like the [unique] package. Note that individual cleanups should
still shunt their work to a new goroutine if they must execute or
block for a long time to avoid blocking the cleanup queue.
