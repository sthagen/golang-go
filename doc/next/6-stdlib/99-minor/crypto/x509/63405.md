[CreateCertificate], [CreateCertificateRequest], and [CreateRevocationList] can now accept a [crypto.MessageSigner] signing interface as well as [crypto.Signer]. This allows these functions to use signers which implement "one-shot" signing interfaces, where hashing is done as part of the signing operation, instead of by the caller.
