// AddCleanup attaches a cleanup function to ptr. Some time after ptr is no longer
// reachable, the runtime will call cleanup(arg) in a separate goroutine.
//
// A typical use is that ptr is an object wrapping an underlying resource (e.g.,
// a File object wrapping an OS file descriptor), arg is the underlying resource
// (e.g., the OS file descriptor), and the cleanup function releases the underlying
// resource (e.g., by calling the close system call).
//
// There are few constraints on ptr. In particular, multiple cleanups may be
// attached to the same pointer, or to different pointers within the same
// allocation.
//
// If ptr is reachable from cleanup or arg, ptr will never be collected
// and the cleanup will never run. As a protection against simple cases of this,
// AddCleanup panics if arg is equal to ptr.
//
// There is no specified order in which cleanups will run.
// In particular, if several objects point to each other and all become
// unreachable at the same time, their cleanups all become eligible to run
// and can run in any order. This is true even if the objects form a cycle.
//
// Cleanups run concurrently with any user-created goroutines.
// Cleanups may also run concurrently with one another (unlike finalizers).
// If a cleanup function must run for a long time, it should create a new goroutine
// to avoid blocking the execution of other cleanups.
//
// If ptr has both a cleanup and a finalizer, the cleanup will only run once
// it has been finalized and becomes unreachable without an associated finalizer.
//
// The cleanup(arg) call is not always guaranteed to run; in particular it is not
// guaranteed to run before program exit.
//
// Cleanups are not guaranteed to run if the size of T is zero bytes, because
// it may share same address with other zero-size objects in memory. See
// https://go.dev/ref/spec#Size_and_alignment_guarantees.
//
// It is not guaranteed that a cleanup will run for objects allocated
// in initializers for package-level variables. Such objects may be
// linker-allocated, not heap-allocated.
//
// Note that because cleanups may execute arbitrarily far into the future
// after an object is no longer referenced, the runtime is allowed to perform
// a space-saving optimization that batches objects together in a single
// allocation slot. The cleanup for an unreferenced object in such an
// allocation may never run if it always exists in the same batch as a
// referenced object. Typically, this batching only happens for tiny
// (on the order of 16 bytes or less) and pointer-free objects.
//
// A cleanup may run as soon as an object becomes unreachable.
// In order to use cleanups correctly, the program must ensure that
// the object is reachable until it is safe to run its cleanup.
// Objects stored in global variables, or that can be found by tracing
// pointers from a global variable, are reachable. A function argument or
// receiver may become unreachable at the last point where the function
// mentions it. To ensure a cleanup does not get called prematurely,
// pass the object to the [KeepAlive] function after the last point
// where the object must remain reachable.
